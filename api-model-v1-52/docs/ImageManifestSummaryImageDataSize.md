| **unpacked** | **kotlin.Long** | Unpacked is the size (in bytes) of the locally unpacked (uncompressed) image content that&#39;s directly usable by the containers running this image. It&#39;s independent of the distributable content - e.g. the image might still have an unpacked data that&#39;s still used by some container even when the distributable/compressed content is already gone.  |  |
