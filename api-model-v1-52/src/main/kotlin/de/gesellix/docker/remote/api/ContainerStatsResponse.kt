 * Statistics sample for a container.

 * @param id ID of the container for which the stats were collected.
 * @param name Name of the container for which the stats were collected.
 * @param osType OSType is the OS of the container (\"linux\" or \"windows\") to allow platform-specific handling of stats.
 * @param read Date and time at which this sample was collected. The value is formatted as [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) with nano-seconds.
 * @param cpuStats
 * @param memoryStats
 * @param networks Network statistics for the container per interface.  This field is omitted if the container has no networking enabled.
 * @param pidsStats
 * @param blkioStats
 * @param numProcs The number of processors on the system.  This field is Windows-specific and always zero for Linux containers.
 * @param storageStats
 * @param preread Date and time at which this first sample was collected. This field is not propagated if the \"one-shot\" option is set. If the \"one-shot\" option is set, this field may be omitted, empty, or set to a default date (`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`).  The value is formatted as [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) with nano-seconds.
