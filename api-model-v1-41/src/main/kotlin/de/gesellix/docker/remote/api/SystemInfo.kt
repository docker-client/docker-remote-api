/**
 *
 *
 * @param ID Unique identifier of the daemon.  <p><br /></p>  > **Note**: The format of the ID itself is not part of the API, and > should not be considered stable.

On Windows this information is queried from the <kbd>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\</kbd> registry value, for example _\"10.0 14393 (14393.1198.amd64fre.rs1_release_sec.170427-1353)\"_.
 * @param operatingSystem Name of the host's operating system, for example: \"Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS\" or \"Windows Server 2016 Datacenter\"
 * @param osVersion Version of the host's operating system  <p><br /></p>  > **Note**: The information returned in this field, including its > very existence, and the formatting of values, should not be considered > stable, and may change without notice.
 * @param osType Generic type of the operating system of the host, as returned by the Go runtime (`GOOS`).  Currently returned values are \"linux\" and \"windows\". A full list of possible values can be found in the [Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment).
 * @param architecture Hardware architecture of the host, as returned by the Go runtime (`GOARCH`).  A full list of possible values can be found in the [Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment).
 * @param NCPU The number of logical CPUs usable by the daemon.  The number of available CPUs is checked by querying the operating system when the daemon starts. Changes to operating system CPU allocation after the daemon is started are not reflected.
 * @param memTotal Total amount of physical memory available on the host, in bytes.
 * @param indexServerAddress Address / URL of the index server that is used for image search, and as a default for user authentication for Docker Hub and Docker Cloud.
 * @param registryConfig
 * @param genericResources User-defined resources can be either Integer resources (e.g, `SSD=3`) or String resources (e.g, `GPU=UUID1`).
 * @param httpProxy HTTP-proxy configured for the daemon. This value is obtained from the [`HTTP_PROXY`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/html_node/Proxies.html) environment variable. Credentials ([user info component](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.1)) in the proxy URL are masked in the API response.  Containers do not automatically inherit this configuration.
 * @param httpsProxy HTTPS-proxy configured for the daemon. This value is obtained from the [`HTTPS_PROXY`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/html_node/Proxies.html) environment variable. Credentials ([user info component](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.1)) in the proxy URL are masked in the API response.  Containers do not automatically inherit this configuration.
 * @param noProxy Comma-separated list of domain extensions for which no proxy should be used. This value is obtained from the [`NO_PROXY`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/html_node/Proxies.html) environment variable.  Containers do not automatically inherit this configuration.
 * @param name Hostname of the host.
 * @param labels User-defined labels (key/value metadata) as set on the daemon.  <p><br /></p>  > **Note**: When part of a Swarm, nodes can both have _daemon_ labels, > set through the daemon configuration, and _node_ labels, set from a > manager node in the Swarm. Node labels are not included in this > field. Node labels can be retrieved using the `/nodes/(id)` endpoint > on a manager node in the Swarm.
 * @param experimentalBuild Indicates if experimental features are enabled on the daemon.
 * @param serverVersion Version string of the daemon.  > **Note**: the [standalone Swarm API](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/swarm-api/) > returns the Swarm version instead of the daemon  version, for example > `swarm/1.2.8`.
 * @param clusterStore URL of the distributed storage backend.   The storage backend is used for multihost networking (to store network and endpoint information) and by the node discovery mechanism.  <p><br /></p>  > **Deprecated**: This field is only propagated when using standalone Swarm > mode, and overlay networking using an external k/v store. Overlay > networks with Swarm mode enabled use the built-in raft store, and > this field will be empty.
 * @param clusterAdvertise The network endpoint that the Engine advertises for the purpose of node discovery. ClusterAdvertise is a `host:port` combination on which the daemon is reachable by other hosts.  <p><br /></p>  > **Deprecated**: This field is only propagated when using standalone Swarm > mode, and overlay networking using an external k/v store. Overlay > networks with Swarm mode enabled use the built-in raft store, and > this field will be empty.
 * @param runtimes List of [OCI compliant](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) runtimes configured on the daemon. Keys hold the \"name\" used to reference the runtime.  The Docker daemon relies on an OCI compliant runtime (invoked via the `containerd` daemon) as its interface to the Linux kernel namespaces, cgroups, and SELinux.  The default runtime is `runc`, and automatically configured. Additional runtimes can be configured by the user and will be listed here.
 * @param defaultRuntime Name of the default OCI runtime that is used when starting containers.  The default can be overridden per-container at create time.
 * @param swarm
 * @param liveRestoreEnabled Indicates if live restore is enabled.  If enabled, containers are kept running when the daemon is shutdown or upon daemon start if running containers are detected.
 * @param isolation Represents the isolation technology to use as a default for containers. The supported values are platform-specific.  If no isolation value is specified on daemon start, on Windows client, the default is `hyperv`, and on Windows server, the default is `process`.  This option is currently not used on other platforms.
 * @param initBinary Name and, optional, path of the `docker-init` binary.  If the path is omitted, the daemon searches the host's `$PATH` for the binary and uses the first result.
 * @param containerdCommit
 * @param runcCommit
 * @param initCommit
 * @param securityOptions List of security features that are enabled on the daemon, such as apparmor, seccomp, SELinux, user-namespaces (userns), and rootless.  Additional configuration options for each security feature may be present, and are included as a comma-separated list of key/value pairs.
 * @param productLicense Reports a summary of the product license on the daemon.  If a commercial license has been applied to the daemon, information such as number of nodes, and expiration are included.
 * @param defaultAddressPools List of custom default address pools for local networks, which can be specified in the daemon.json file or dockerd option.  Example: a Base \"10.10.0.0/16\" with Size 24 will define the set of 256 10.10.[0-255].0/24 address pools.
 * @param warnings List of warnings / informational messages about missing features, or issues related to the daemon configuration.  These messages can be printed by the client as information to the user.
