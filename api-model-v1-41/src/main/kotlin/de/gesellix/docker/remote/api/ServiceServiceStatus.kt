 * The status of the service's tasks. Provided only when requested as part of a ServiceList operation.

 * @param completedTasks The number of tasks for a job that are in the Completed state. This field must be cross-referenced with the service type, as the value of 0 may mean the service is not in a job mode, or it may mean the job-mode service has no tasks yet Completed.
